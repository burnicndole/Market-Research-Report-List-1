<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertebral Compression Fracture Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Kyphoplasty Devices</li><li>Vertebroplasty Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vertebral compression fracture devices market primarily includes balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty devices. Balloon kyphoplasty involves the insertion of a balloon into the fractured vertebra, which is then inflated to restore height before being filled with bone cement. This technique is minimally invasive and aims to alleviate pain while stabilizing the fracture. Vertebroplasty, on the other hand, involves direct injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebra without balloon inflation, offering a simpler, faster procedure for pain relief and stabilization.</p></p>
